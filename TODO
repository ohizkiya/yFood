GLOBAL:
 * Factor out JS/AJAX into seperate file
 * ADD (SMTP) EMAIL CAPABILITIES (need a mail class that is BSD compat, else roll one out)
 * Bug: Searching the same date as an event shows nothing (easy to fix)
 * Remove unused images, create sprites where possible

USER:
 * Basic user controls - SMS
 * Validate email - before My Library, SMS usage
 * USER ROLES
 o SMS & Email alerts prior to event

EVENTS:
 * AJAX functionality
    - Share this event
    - Flag for review?
    - (admin) Edit/Remove event
 * Submit Event functionality & admin review


ADMIN:
 * Basic admin panel
    - Administer users
    - ADD EVENT!
    - Delete event
    - Administer Campuses

IDEAS:
 o Export to outlook/google cal/etc
 - Save, SMS, verified accts, and other features should 
   be put on hold to speed up launch?

EVENTUALLY:
 - Better error handling (exceptions?)
 - Better DBAC (PDO?)
 - Perhaps ORM (redbean?)
 - Frameworks (& Bootstrap?)
 - Basic disk caching (no need right now)
 * Better responsiveness (messages, etc)
 - Installation system
