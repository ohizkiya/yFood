GLOBAL:
 * Factor out JS/AJAX into seperate file
 o Share Event option
 * ADD (SMTP) EMAIL CAPABILITIES
 o Remove food icon stuff
 * Bug: Searching the same date as an event shows nothing (easy to fix)

USER:
 * Reset password functionality
 * Basic user controls - Overview, SMS, change pwd
 * Validate email - before My Library, SMS usage
 * USER ROLES

EVENTS:
 * AJAX functionality
    - Share this event
    - Flag for review?
    - (admin) Edit/Remove event
 * Submit Event functionality & admin review
 o Does My Events more-or-less work? (Seems so - 07 Aug 11)


ADMIN:
 * Basic admin panel
    - Add/modify/delete events
    - Add/modify/delete users
    - Stats?
    - Edit data (e.g. campuses)


IDEAS:
 o Export to outlook/google cal/etc
 o Basic caching for food types & campuses

EVENTUALLY:
 - Better error handling (exceptions?)
 - Admin panel for config
 - Better DBAC
 - Perhaps ORM (redbean?)
 - Framework (+Bootstrap?)

KEY:
 * = Important
 o = Unimportant
 - = Sub-item
